# visualization project

This project includes a map and a barchart that can be used to visualize the population and area of each state in the US. All the texts on the left side are clickable. There are six different ways to visualize the populaiton and area, which includes size, value, orientation, color, shape and texture. The figure below shows an example of the map and barchart. When clicking on the value under population, the map presents the polulation by different state into different greayscale according to their values. The bottom barchart can be selected to show population or area by state. When hovering over a bar in the barchart, there will be a tip showing the value of the bar, and the corresponding state in the map will be highlighted.
